# PC-album-art-display

This is a concept of a display/device that hooks into what music you are listening to on your PC and/or acts as a display for built-in functions such as the pop-out built into iTunes (For windows) and shows the album art of whatever music you listening to. Inspired by the recent addition of full-screen album art in IOS and the aforementioned pop-out in iTunes this device is for those that often listen to music on their PCs while working and want to appreciate the cover art.

 I'm currently looking for collaborators who can help make this a reality. I'm looking for people who are interested in taking on this project as a (side) passion project. I'm a CAD and prototyping guy, not an electrical engineer, and I need people who can do the device's software and hardware. Hit me up if you're interested in taking up this as a cool project.
